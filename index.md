## About the Learning Salon

 
The Learning Salon is a weekly forum in which we explore bridges and contentions in biological and artificial learning. Each week our guest helps us uncover core theories, assumptions, and questions that lurk underneath the overwhelming proliferation of approaches to studying learning and intelligence.

Humans are often assumed to represent the apex of learning and cognition, and arguably achieving or surpassing human cognitive capacity is the goal of AI. And yet, dogs, rats, flies, and machines can also learn specific tasks, sometimes exceeding human performance. In The Learning Salon, we explore this conundrum by bringing together people with different philosophies, disciplinary backgrounds, and approaches. People at different stages of their careers or outside of academia altogether are equally welcome.
